# XOR-Problem-ML(TensorFlow.js)

XOR problem is real world research problem in neural network. 
in XOR [0, 0] = [0], 
       [0, 1] = [1], 
       [1, 0] = [1], 
       [1, 1] = [0] 
So, it is not predictable that from which part to start, I had tried but it gives me one right output in 7-8 tries.
So, any one have solution can contact me or message me in mail given in my profile.
